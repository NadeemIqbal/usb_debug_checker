GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program— to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of freedom as in "free speech," not as in "free beer." 

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid you to deprive others of these rights or to ask others to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, can change the software and use it privately, and that they know they are doing so.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distributing, and modifying are found in the sections below.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any work or works covered by this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you."

   "Modify" means to adapt or alter the Program or any part of it, including but not limited to translation, alteration, or addition to the Program.

   "The Source Code" refers to the preferred form for making modifications to the Program.

   "Object Code" refers to any non-source form of the Program.

1. Source Code.

   The Program’s source code is the collection of files necessary to modify the Program. You must provide the source code of the Program when distributing it in object code form unless you are distributing it under an exception described below.

2. Basic Permissions.

   You can copy, distribute, and modify the Program, provided that you meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must release the source code under this license, with a copy of the license included, when distributing copies or derivative works.

   (b) You must pass along the GPL license and not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted under it.

   (c) You must make sure that modified versions are clearly marked as modified and are made available under this license as well.

3. Protecting Users' Rights.

   You must ensure that your users can use the Program with freedom, even if the software is distributed in modified form. If you offer support or install the Program for a user, you must ensure that they have access to the source code and know their rights.

4. Distribution of Modified Versions.

   If you modify the Program and distribute it, you must release your modifications under the GPL and provide access to the source code.

5. Patent Grants.

   By offering the Program under this License, you grant a patent license to users of the software, including the right to distribute and modify the software.

6. No Warranty.

   The Program is distributed with no warranty. You cannot hold the authors or distributors liable for damages resulting from its use.

7. Additional Terms.

   You may add your own terms, as long as they do not contradict the GPL. However, you cannot use the GPL to impose further restrictions on how others use the software.
